* Fraction of the population with various degrees of education
* Fraction of the population that commutes in various ways

* Median household income
* Mean household income
* Fraction of the (civilian) population with/without health insurance

Please note that we are willing (and easily able!) to add other years or variables if there is interest --- The variables that we do include are because people have asked about them.
