COMMENT ON TABLE data.mobility_dex is E'For a smartphone residing in a given geography, how many distinct devices also visited any of the commercial venues that this device visited today?
The county-level DEX reports the county-level average of this number across all devices residing in the county that day. The DEX values are necessarily only a fraction of the number of distinct individuals that also visited any of the commercial venues visited by a device, since only a fraction of individuals, venues, and visits are in the device sample.

The state-level DEX reports the state-level average of this number across all devices residing in the state that day. The DEX values are necessarily only a fraction of the number of distinct individuals that also visited any of the commercial venues visited by a device, since only a fraction of individuals, venues, and visits are in the device sample.

In the context of the ongoing pandemic, the DEX measure may be biased if devices sheltering-in-place are not in the sample due to lack of movement. We report adjusted DEX values to help address this selection bias. DEX-adjusted is computed assuming that the number of devices has not declined since the early-2020 peak and that unobserved devices did not visit any commercial venues.

This index is produced by Victor Couture, Jonathan Dingel, Allison Green, Jessie Handbury, and Kevin Williams with assistance from Hayden Parsley and Serena Xu. They are derived from anonymized, aggregated smartphone movement data provided by PlaceIQ. We are grateful to the authors and to PlaceIQ for making this data available to us.

If you use this dataset, we recommend seeing the [notes for users of the DEX dataset](https://github.com/COVIDExposureIndices/COVIDExposureIndices/blob/master/documentation/DEX_notes.md) and [DEX documentation](https://github.com/COVIDExposureIndices/COVIDExposureIndices/blob/master/documentation/DEX.pdf) produced by the original authors.
