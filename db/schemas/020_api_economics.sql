COMMENT ON VIEW api.economics IS E'This table contains information on economic outcomes as time series data

These variables tend to be observed at a daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly frequency and we can use them to think
about changes in the economy as opposed to the slow moving variables included in the `economic_snapshots` table

These economic variables currently include:

* Weekly Economic Index produced by Jim Stock
* State unemployment claims (county forthcoming)

These variables are collected from a variety of sources.

COMMENT ON VIEW api.economic_snapshots IS E'This table contains information on economic characteristics of different geographic areas.

These variables are not typically collected at a sufficiently high frequency to use them as time-series data but rather we use
them to characterize the economic features of different locations. For example, while unemployment claims is observed on a
weekly basis, data on the industry make-up of a geographic region is only available at a yearly frequency.

The variables currently included here are:

* Industry specific GDP at the county/state level

These variables are collected from a variety of sources.
