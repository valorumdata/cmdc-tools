**Table Description:**

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex.

Detailed Tables, Subject Tables, Data Profiles, Comparison Profiles and Selected Population Profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.

This table contains the values collected by the Census -- It should be merged with the `acs_variables` to identify which variables the values are associated with.

Words of caution:
